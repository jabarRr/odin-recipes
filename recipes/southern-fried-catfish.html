        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound catfish fillets, cut in strips</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups fine cornmeal</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay™</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Cook: </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix buttermilk, water, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour mixture into a flat pan large enough to hold fillets.</li>
            <li>Arrange fillets in a single layer in the pan, turning to coat each side. Set aside to marinate.</li>
            <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, and seafood seasoning in a 2-gallon resealable plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Add fillets to the bag, a few at a time, and tumble gently until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Fry fillets in hot
                 oil until crisp and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Work in batches to avoid
                overcrowding, so fillets have room to brown properly.</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels.</li>
